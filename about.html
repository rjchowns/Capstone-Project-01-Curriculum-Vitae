<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am a self-taught web developer with three years of hands-on experience creating reliable, 
  user-focused web solutions. I bring over 20 years of professional experience as a Career Adviser, 
  Training Professional, and former HM Forces member, which has shaped my disciplined approach, 
  strong leadership skills, and ability to deliver high-quality outcomes under pressure.
  My previous experiences enable me to clearly understand user needs, communicate technical concepts 
  effectively, and translate complex requirements into practical, well-structured digital solutions. Highly organised, adaptable, 
  and driven by continuous improvement, I work confidently both independently and collaboratively, 
  managing projects from concept through to delivery with professionalism, integrity, and attention 
  to detail.

<h2>Background</h2>
<p>I was a dedicated Career Adviser and Training Professional with over 20 year,s experience 
  supporting individuals to develop skills, build confidence, and make informed career decisions. 
  My background within the HM Forces has provided me with a strong foundation in leadership, 
  integrity, team cohesion and people development, alongside extensive experience in adult education, coaching, 
  and workforce development</p>

<p>Throughout my career, I have worked closely with individuals from diverse backgrounds, offering 
  one-to-one guidance, career coaching, and confidential support tailored to individual needs. 
  I specialise in helping people identify transferable skills, explore realistic career pathways, 
  and create structured action plans that support long-term progression. My approach is 
  client-centred, supportive, and empowering, using motivational interviewing and reflective 
  questioning to encourage positive decision-making.</p>

<p>As a qualified adult educator and coach, I have designed and delivered training programmes, 
  workshops, and learning resources that address skills gaps and promote personal development. 
  I am particularly passionate about supporting individuals at career transition points, whether 
  entering employment, changing direction, or progressing within their current role.</p>

<p>I pride myself on being approachable, ethical, and professional, with a strong commitment to 
  equality, confidentiality, and continuous development. I believe that with the right guidance, 
  encouragement, and practical support, everyone has the potential to achieve meaningful and 
  sustainable career outcomes.</p>

<h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>Outside of web development, I prioritise continuous learning and personal development, 
  regularly exploring new technologies and refining my technical skills through personal projects. 
  I train in boxing and Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, which reinforce discipline, focus, resilience, and 
  strategic thinking—qualities I also bring to my professional work. I value family time highly, 
  recognising the importance of balance, perspective, and consistency, and I believe these 
  interests support a focused, motivated, and sustainable approach to both work and life.</p>
